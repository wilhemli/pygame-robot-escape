# pygame-robot-escape
a collecting game style pygame I made for my programming class. I think I solved all issues that were occurring but I can't be sure

There is an optional easy mode, to turn it on you need to call the Escape class with True, rather than False
i.e changle the last line of code to Escape(True)
The easy mode toddles visible paths for the monsters in the game
IMO it becomes a little too easy, but it might be good to turn on just to see the paths and get an idea of them
i did leave it off by default on purpose though
